SYNOPSIS</FONT></H1>
</A>


<P>
Here's some pretty basic code for <B>parsing a MIME message,</B> and outputting
its decoded components to a given directory:


<P>
<PRE>    use MIME::Parser;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Create parser, and set the output directory:
    my $parser = new MIME::Parser;
    $parser-&gt;output_dir(&quot;$ENV{HOME}/mimemail&quot;);</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Parse input:
    $entity = $parser-&gt;read(\*STDIN) or die &quot;couldn't parse MIME stream&quot;;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Take a look at the top-level entity (and any parts it has):
    $entity-&gt;dump_skeleton; </PRE>



<P>
Here's some code which <B>composes and sends a MIME message</B> containing 
three parts: a text file, an attached GIF, and some more text:


<P>
<PRE>    use MIME::Entity;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Create the top-level, and set up the mail headers:
    $top = build MIME::Entity Type    =&gt;&quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                              From    =&gt; &quot;me\@myhost.com&quot;,
	                      To      =&gt; &quot;you\@yourhost.com&quot;,
                              Subject =&gt; &quot;Hello, nurse!&quot;;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Part #1: a simple text document: 
    attach $top  Path=&gt;&quot;./testin/short.txt&quot;;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Part #2: a GIF file:
    attach $top  Path        =&gt; &quot;./docs/mime-sm.gif&quot;,
                 Type        =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                 Encoding    =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Part #3: some literal text:
    attach $top  Data=&gt;$message;</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>    # Send it:
    open MAIL, &quot;| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -i&quot; or die &quot;open: $!&quot;;
    $top-&gt;print(\*MAIL);
    close MAIL;</PRE>

DESCRIPTION</FONT></H1>
</A>


<P>
MIME-tools is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing, decoding,
<I>and generating</I> single- or multipart (even nested multipart) MIME 
messages.  (Yes, kids, that means you can send messages with attached 
GIF files).

Overview of the classes</FONT></H2>
</A>


<P>
Here are the classes you'll generally be dealing with directly:


<P>
<PRE>           .------------.       .------------.           
           | MIME::     |------&gt;| MIME::     |
           | Parser     |  isa  | ParserBase |   
           `------------'       `------------'
              | parse()
              | returns a...
              |
              |
              |
              |    head()       .--------.
              |    returns...   | MIME:: | get()
              V       .--------&gt;| Head   | etc... 
           .--------./          `--------'      
     .---&gt; | MIME:: | 
     `-----| Entity |           .--------. 
   parts() `--------'\          | MIME:: | 
   returns            `--------&gt;| Body   |
   sub-entities    bodyhandle() `--------'
   (if any)        returns...       | open() 
                                    | returns...
                                    | 
                                    V  
                                .--------. read()    
                                | IO::   | getline()  
                                | Handle | print()          
                                `--------' etc...    </PRE>



<P>
To illustrate, parsing works this way:

<UL>

<P><LI><B>The &quot;parser&quot; parses the MIME stream.</B>
Every &quot;parser&quot; inherits from the &quot;parser base&quot; class, which does
the real work.  When a message is parsed, the result is an &quot;entity&quot;.


<P><LI><B>An &quot;entity&quot; has a &quot;head&quot; and a &quot;body&quot;.</B>  
Entities are MIME message parts.


<P><LI><B>A &quot;body&quot; knows where the data is.</B>  
You can ask to &quot;open&quot; this data source for <I>reading</I> or <I>writing</I>, 
and you will get back an &quot;I/O handle&quot;.


<P><LI><B>An &quot;I/O handle&quot; knows how to read/write the data.</B>
It is an object that is basically like an IO::Handle or 
a FileHandle... it can be any class, so long as it supports a small,
standard set of methods for reading from or writing to the underlying
data source.

</UL>


<P>
A typical multipart message containing two parts -- a textual greeting 
and an &quot;attached&quot; GIF file -- would be a tree of MIME::Entity objects,
each of which would have its own MIME::Head.  Like this:


<P>
<PRE>    .--------.
    | MIME:: | Content-type: multipart/mixed 
    | Entity | Subject: Happy Samhaine!
    `--------'
         |
         `----.
        parts |
              |   .--------.   
              |---| MIME:: | Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
              |   | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
              |   `--------' 
              |   .--------.   
              |---| MIME:: | Content-type: image/gif
                  | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: base64
                  `--------' Content-disposition: inline; filename=&quot;hs.gif&quot;</PRE>

<A HREF="#__top"><IMG SRC="h2bullet.gif" ALT="" BORDER="0"></A>
Parsing, in a nutshell</FONT></H2>
</A>


<P>
You usually start by creating an instance of <B><A HREF="Parser.pm.html">MIME::Parser</A></B> (a subclass
of the abstract <B><A HREF="ParserBase.pm.html">MIME::ParserBase</A></B>), and setting up
certain parsing parameters: what directory to save extracted files 
to, how to name the files, etc.


<P>
You then give that instance a readable filehandle on which waits a
MIME message.  If all goes well, you will get back a <B><A HREF="Entity.pm.html">MIME::Entity</A></B>
object (a subclass of <B>Mail::Internet</B>), which consists of...

<UL>

<P><LI>A <B>MIME::Head</B> (a subclass of <B>Mail::Header</B>) which holds the MIME 
header data.


<P><LI>A <B>MIME::Body</B>, which is a object that knows where the body data is.
You ask this object to &quot;open&quot; itself for reading, and it
will hand you back an &quot;I/O handle&quot; for reading the data: this is
a FileHandle-like object, and could be of any class, so long as it
conforms to a subset of the <B>IO::Handle</B> interface.

</UL>


<P>
If the original message was a multipart document, the MIME::Entity
object will have a non-empty list of &quot;parts&quot;, each of which is in 
turn a MIME::Entity (which might also be a multipart entity, etc, 
etc...).


<P>
Internally, the parser (in MIME::ParserBase) asks for instances 
of <B>MIME::Decoder</B> whenever it needs to decode an encoded file.  
MIME::Decoder has a mapping from supported encodings (e.g., 'base64') 
to classes whose instances can decode them.  You can add to this mapping 
to try out new/experiment encodings.  You can also use 
MIME::Decoder by itself.

<H2><FONT COLOR=#600020>
<A HREF="#__top"><IMG SRC="h2bullet.gif" ALT="" BORDER="0"></A>
Composing, in a nutshell</FONT></H2>
</A>


<P>
All message composition is done via the <B><A HREF="Entity.pm.html">MIME::Entity</A></B> class.
For single-part messages, you can use the <A HREF="Entity.pm.html#build">MIME::Entity/build</A>
constructor to create MIME entities very easily.


<P>
For multipart messages, you can start by creating a top-level
<CODE>multipart</CODE> entity with <A HREF="Entity.pm.html#build">MIME::Entity/build</A>, and then use
the similar <A HREF="Entity.pm.html#attach">MIME::Entity/attach</A> method to attach parts to 
that message.  <I>Please note:</I> what most people think of as 
&quot;a text message with an attached GIF file&quot; is <I>really</I> a multipart
message with 2 parts: the first being the text message, and the
second being the GIF file.


<P>
When building MIME a entity, you'll have to provide two very important
pieces of information: the <I>content type</I> and the 
<I>content transfer encoding</I>.  The type is usually easy, as it is directly 
determined by the file format; e.g., an HTML file is <CODE>text/html</CODE>.   
The encoding, however, is trickier... for example, some HTML files are
<CODE>7bit</CODE>-compliant, but others might have very long lines and would need to be
sent <CODE>quoted-printable</CODE> for reliability.


<P>
See the section on encoding/decoding for more details, as well as
<A HREF="#a_mime_primer">&quot;A MIME PRIMER&quot;</A>.


<P><HR>
<A NAME="encodingdecoding_in_a_nutshell">
<H2><FONT COLOR=#600020>
<A HREF="#__top"><IMG SRC="h2bullet.gif" ALT="" BORDER="0"></A>
Encoding/decoding, in a nutshell</FONT></H2>
</A>


<P>
The <A HREF="Decoder.pm.html">MIME::Decoder</A> class can be used to <I>encode</I> as well; this is done
when printing MIME entities.  All the standard encodings are supported
(see <A HREF="#a_mime_primer">&quot;A MIME PRIMER&quot;</A> for details):


<P>
<PRE>    Encoding...       Normally used when message contents are...
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    7bit              7-bit data with under 1000 chars/line, or multipart.
    8bit              8-bit data with under 1000 chars/line.
    binary            8-bit data with possibly long lines (or no line breaks).
    quoted-printable  Text files with some 8-bit chars (e.g., Latin-1 text).
    base64            Binary files.</PRE>



<P>
Which encoding you choose for a given document depends largely on 
(1) what you know about the document's contents (text vs binary), and
(2) whether you need the resulting message to have a reliable encoding
for 7-bit Internet email transport.


<P>
In general, only <CODE>quoted-printable</CODE> and <CODE>base64</CODE> guarantee reliable
transport of all data; the other three &quot;no-encoding&quot; encodings simply
pass the data through, and are only reliable if that data is 7bit ASCII 
with under 1000 characters per line, and has no conflicts with the
multipart boundaries.


<P>
I've considered making it so that the content-type and encoding
can be automatically inferred from the file's path, but that seems
to be asking for trouble... or at least, for Mail::Cap...

<UL>

<P><LI><B>Run with <CODE>-w</CODE> on.</B>  If you see a warning about a deprecated method,
change your code ASAP.  This will ease upgrades tremendously.


<P><LI><B>Don't try to MIME-encode using the non-standard MIME encodings.</B>
It's just not a good practice if you want people to be able to
read your messages.


<P><LI><B>Be aware of possible thrown exceptions.</B>
For example, if your mail-handling code absolutely must not die, 
then perform mail parsing like this:


<P>
<PRE>    $entity = eval { $parser-&gt;parse(\*INPUT) };</PRE>



<P>
Parsing is a complex process, and some components may throw exceptions
if seriously-bad things happen.  Since &quot;seriously-bad&quot; is in the
eye of the beholder, you're better off <I>catching</I> possible exceptions 
instead of asking me to propagate <CODE>undef</CODE> up the stack.  Use of exceptions in
reusable modules is one of those religious issues we're never all 
going to agree upon; thankfully, that's what <CODE>eval{}</CODE> is good for.

Terminology</FONT></H2>
</A>


<P>
Here are some excerpts from RFC-1521 explaining the terminology
we use; each is accompanied by the equivalent in MIME:: module terms...

<DL>
<P><DT><B><A NAME="message">Message</A></B><DD>

From RFC-1521:


<P>
<PRE>    The term &quot;message&quot;, when not further qualified, means either the
    (complete or &quot;top-level&quot;) message being transferred on a network, or
    a message encapsulated in a body of type &quot;message&quot;.</PRE>



<P>
There currently is no explicit package for messages; under MIME::, 
messages are streams of data which may be read in from files or 
filehandles.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="body">Body part</A></B><DD>

From RFC-1521:


<P>
<PRE>    The term &quot;body part&quot;, in this document, means one of the parts of the
    body of a multipart entity. A body part has a header and a body, so
    it makes sense to speak about the body of a body part.</PRE>



<P>
Since a body part is just a kind of entity (see below), a body part 
is represented by an instance of <A HREF="Entity.pm.html">MIME::Entity</A>.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="entity">Entity</A></B><DD>

From RFC-1521:


<P>
<PRE>    The term &quot;entity&quot;, in this document, means either a message or a body
    part.  All kinds of entities share the property that they have a
    header and a body.</PRE>



<P>
An entity is represented by an instance of <A HREF="Entity.pm.html">MIME::Entity</A>.
There are instance methods for recovering the header (a <A HREF="Head.pm.html">MIME::Head</A>)
and the body (a <A HREF="Body.pm.html">MIME::Body</A>).


<P><DT><B><A NAME="header">Header</A></B><DD>

This is the top portion of the MIME message, which contains the
Content-type, Content-transfer-encoding, etc.  Every MIME entity has
a header, represented by an instance of <A HREF="Head.pm.html">MIME::Head</A>.  You get the
header of an entity by sending it a head() message.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="body">Body</A></B><DD>

From RFC-1521:


<P>
<PRE>    The term &quot;body&quot;, when not further qualified, means the body of an
    entity, that is the body of either a message or of a body part.</PRE>



<P>
A body is represented by an instance of <A HREF="Body.pm.html">MIME::Body</A>.  You get the
body of an entity by sending it a bodyhandle() message.

<P>
As of 4.x, MIME-tools can no longer emulate the old MIME-parser
distribution.  If you're installing this as a replacement for the 
MIME-parser 1.x release, you'll have to do a little tinkering with
your code.

<DL>
<P><DT><B><A NAME="why">Why assume that MIME objects are email objects?</A></B><DD>

I quote from Achim Bohnet, who gave feedback on v.1.9 (I think
he's using the word <I>header</I> where I would use <I>field</I>; e.g.,
to refer to &quot;Subject:&quot;, &quot;Content-type:&quot;, etc.):


<P>
<PRE>    There is also IMHO no requirement [for] MIME::Heads to look 
    like [email] headers; so to speak, the MIME::Head [simply stores] 
    the attributes of a complex object, e.g.:</PRE>



<P>
<PRE>        new MIME::Head type =&gt; &quot;text/plain&quot;,
                       charset =&gt; ...,
                       disposition =&gt; ..., ... ;</PRE>



<P>
I agree in principle, but (alas and dammit) RFC-1521 says otherwise.
RFC-1521 [MIME] headers are a syntactic subset of RFC-822 [email] headers.
Perhaps a better name for these modules would be RFC1521:: instead of
MIME::, but we're a little beyond that stage now.  (<I>Note: RFC-1521 
has recently been obsoleted by RFCs 2045-2049, so it's just as well 
we didn't go that route...</I>)


<P>
However, in my mind's eye, I see a mythical abstract class which does what 
Achim suggests... so you could say:


<P>
<PRE>     my $attrs = new MIME::Attrs type =&gt; &quot;text/plain&quot;,
				 charset =&gt; ...,
                                 disposition =&gt; ..., ... ;</PRE>



<P>
We could even make it a superclass or companion class of MIME::Head, 
such that MIME::Head would allow itself to be initiallized from a

<P><DT><B><A NAME="to">To subclass or not to subclass?</A></B><DD>

When I originally wrote these modules for the CPAN, I agonized for a long
time about whether or not they really should subclass from <B>Mail::Internet</B> 
(then at version 1.17).  Thanks to Graham Barr, who graciously evolved
MailTools 1.06 to be more MIME-friendly, unification was achieved
at MIME-tools release 2.0.   The benefits in reuse alone have been
substantial.

<P><DT><B><A NAME="fuzzing">Fuzzing of CRLF and newline on input</A></B><DD>

RFC-1521 dictates that MIME streams have lines terminated by CRLF
(<CODE>&quot;\r\n&quot;</CODE>).  However, it is extremely likely that folks will want to 
parse MIME streams where each line ends in the local newline 
character <CODE>&quot;\n&quot;</CODE> instead.


<P>
An attempt has been made to allow the parser to handle both CRLF 
and newline-terminated input.


<P>
<I>See MIME::ParserBase for further details.</I>


<P><DT><B><A NAME="fuzzing">Fuzzing of CRLF and newline when decoding</A></B><DD>

The <CODE>&quot;7bit&quot;</CODE> and <CODE>&quot;8bit&quot;</CODE> decoders will decode both
a <CODE>&quot;\n&quot;</CODE> and a <CODE>&quot;\r\n&quot;</CODE> end-of-line sequence into a <CODE>&quot;\n&quot;</CODE>.


<P>
The <CODE>&quot;binary&quot;</CODE> decoder (default if no encoding specified) 
still outputs stuff verbatim... so a MIME message with CRLFs 
and no explicit encoding will be output as a text file 
that, on many systems, will have an annoying ^M at the end of
each line... <I>but this is as it should be</I>.


<P>
<I>See MIME::ParserBase for further details.</I>


<P><DT><B><A NAME="fuzzing">Fuzzing of CRLF and newline when encoding/composing</A></B><DD>

All encoders currently output the end-of-line sequence as a <CODE>&quot;\n&quot;</CODE>,
with the assumption that the local mail agent will perform
the conversion from newline to CRLF when sending the mail.


<P>
However, there probably should be an option to output CRLF as per RFC-1521.
I'm currently working on a good mechanism for this.


<P>
<I>See MIME::ParserBase for further details.</I>


<P><DT><B><A NAME="inability">Inability to handle multipart boundaries with embedded newlines</A></B><DD>

First, let's get something straight: this is an evil, EVIL practice.
If your mailer creates multipart boundary strings that contain 
newlines, give it two weeks notice and find another one.  If your
mail robot receives MIME mail like this, regard it as syntactically
incorrect, which it is.

This is how the message body is packaged up for safe transit.
There are the 5 major MIME encodings.
A more-comprehensive listing may be found in RFC-2045.

<DL>
<P><DT><B><A NAME="7bit">7bit</A></B><DD>

No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that no
8-bit characters are present, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters 
in length (including the CRLF).


<P><DT><B><A NAME="8bit">8bit</A></B><DD>

No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the message 
might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters 
in length (including the CRLF).


<P><DT><B><A NAME="binary">binary</A></B><DD>

No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the message 
might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines may exceed 1000 characters 
in length.  Such messages are the <I>least</I> likely to get through mail 
gateways.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="base64">base64</A></B><DD>

A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary binary data to the 7bit domain.
Like &quot;uuencode&quot;, but very well-defined.  This is how you should send
essentially binary information (tar files, GIFs, JPEGs, etc.).


<P><DT><B><A NAME="quoted">quoted-printable</A></B><DD>

A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary line-oriented data to the
7bit domain.  Useful for encoding messages which are textual in
nature, yet which contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., Latin-1,
Latin-2, or any other 8-bit alphabet).

<B>Gzip64-encoding has been improved, and turned off as a default,</B>

<P>
<B>MIME::IO deprecated.</B>

	You can now deep-copy MIME entities (except for on-disk data files).


<P><DT><B><A NAME="encoding">Encoding/decoding</A></B><DD>

<B>MIME::Latin1 deprecated, and 8-to-7 mapping removed.</B> 
	Really, MIME::Latin1 was one of my more dumber ideas.  
	It's still there, but if you want to map 8-bit characters to 
	Latin1 ASCII approximations when 7bit encoding, you'll have to 
	request it explicitly.	<I>But use quoted-printable for your 8-bit 
	documents; that's what it's there for!</I>


<P>
<B>7bit and 8bit &quot;encoders&quot; no longer encode.</B>
	As per RFC-2045, these just do a pass-through of the data,
	but they'll warn you if you send bad data through.


<P>
<B>MIME::Entity suggests encoding.</B>
	Now you can ask MIME::Entity's build() method to &quot;suggest&quot;
	a legal encoding based on the body and the content-type.
	No more guesswork!  See the &quot;mimesend&quot; example.


<P>
<B>New module structure for MIME::Decoder classes.</B> 
	It should be easier for you to see what's happening.


<P>
<B>New MIME decoders!</B>  
	Support added for decoding <CODE>x-uuencode</CODE>, and for 
	decoding/encoding <CODE>x-gzip64</CODE>.  You'll need &quot;gzip&quot; to make
	the latter work.


<P>
<B>Quoted-printable back on track... and then some.</B>
	The 'quoted-printable' decoder now uses the newest MIME::QuotedPrint,
	and amends its output with guideline #8 from RFC2049 (From/.).

<P>
<B>The &quot;multipart/digest&quot; semantics are now preserved.</B> 
	Parts of digest messages have their mime_type() defaulted 
	to &quot;message/rfc822&quot; instead of &quot;text/plain&quot;, as per the RFC.
	<I>Thanks to Carsten Heyl for suggesting this.</I>


<P><DT><B><A NAME="output">Output</A></B><DD>

<B>Well-defined, more-complete print() output.</B>
	When printing an entity, the output is now well-defined if the
	entity came from a MIME::Parser, even if using parse_nested_messages.
	See MIME::Entity for details.


<P>
<B>You can prevent recommended filenames from being output.</B> 
	This possible security hole has been plugged; when building MIME 
	entities, you can specify a body path but suppress the filename
	in the header.

<B>Bug in MIME::Head::original_text fixed.</B>
	Well, it took a while, but another bug surfaced from my transition 
	from 1.x to 2.x.  This method was, quite idiotically, sorting the 
	header fields.
	<I>Thanks, as usual, to Andreas Koenig for spotting this one.</I>


<P>
<B>MIME::ParserBase no longer defaults to RFC-1522-decoding headers.</B>
	The documentation correctly stated that the default setting was 
	to <I>not</I> RFC-1522-decode the headers.  The code, on the other hand,
	was init'ing this parser option in the &quot;on&quot; position.  
	This has been fixed.


<P>
<B>MIME::ParserBase::parse_nested_messages reexamined.</B>
	If you use this feature, please re-read the documentation.
	It explains a little more precisely what the ramifications are.


<P>
<B>MIME::Entity tries harder to ensure MIME compliance.</B>
	It is now a fatal error to use certain bad combinations of content
	type and encoding when &quot;building&quot;, or to attempt to &quot;attach&quot; to
	anything that is not a multipart document.  My apologies if this
	inconveniences anyone, but it was just too darn easy before for folks
	to create bad MIME, and gosh darn it, good libraries should at least
	<I>try</I> to protect you from mistakes.


<P>
<B>The &quot;make&quot; now halts if you don't have the right stuff,</B> 
	provided your MakeMaker supports PREREQ_PM.  See the <A HREF="#requirements">&quot;REQUIREMENTS&quot;</A>

	old courtesy copies of the MIME:: decoding modules.
<I>Thanks to Hugo van der Sanden for suggesting this.</I>


<P>
<B>The &quot;make test&quot; is far less chatty.</B>
	Okay, okay, STDERR is evil.  Now a <CODE>&quot;make test&quot;</CODE> will just give you

<P><DT><B><A NAME="version">Version 3.203</A></B><DD>

<B>No, there haven't been any major changes between 2.x and 3.x.</B>
	The major-version increase was from a few more tweaks to get $VERSION
	to be calculated better and more efficiently (I had been using RCS
	version numbers in a way which created problems for users of CPAN::).
	After a couple of false starts, all modules have been upgraded to RCS
	3.201 or higher.


<P>
<B>You can now parse a MIME message from a scalar,</B> 
	an array-of-scalars, or any MIME::IO-compliant object (including IO::
	objects.)  Take a look at parse_data() in MIME::ParserBase.  The
	parser code has been modified to support the MIME::IO interface.
	<I>Thanks to fellow Chicagoan Tim Pierce (and countless others) 
	for asking.</I>


<P>
<B>More sensible toolkit configuration.</B>
	A new config() method in MIME::ToolUtils makes a lot of toolkit-wide
	configuration cleaner.  Your old calls will still work, but with
	deprecation warnings.

	<I>Thanks to Tim Pierce for bringing the basic problem to my attention.</I>


<P>
<B>Many warnings are now silent unless $^W is true.</B>  
	That means unless you run your Perl with <CODE>-w</CODE>, you won't see 
        deprecation warnings, non-fatal-error messages, etc.  
        But of course you run with <CODE>-w</CODE>, so this doesn't affect you.  <CODE>:-)</CODE>

	<I>Thanks to Kent Boortz for providing the idea, and the baseline

<B>Building MIME messages is even easier.</B>  
	Now, when you use MIME::Entity's <CODE>build()</CODE> or <CODE>attach()</CODE>, 
	you can also supply individual 
	mail headers to set (e.g., <CODE>-Subject</CODE>, <CODE>-From</CODE>, <CODE>-To</CODE>).

Added <CODE>Disposition</CODE> to MIME::Entity's <CODE>build()</CODE> method.
	<I>Thanks to Kurt Freytag for suggesting this feature.</I>


<P>
An <CODE>X-Mailer</CODE> header is now output 
	by default in all MIME-Entity-prepared messages,

Hey, 5.001'ers: let me know if this breaks stuff, okay?


<P>
Added unsupported ./examples directory.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="version">Version 1.11</A></B><DD>

Converted over to using Makefile.PL.  
<I>Thanks to Andreas Koenig for the much-needed kick in the pants...</I>


<P>
Added t/*.t files for testing.  Eeeeeeeeeeeh...it's a start.


<P>
Fixed bug in default parsing routine for generating 
output paths; it was warning about evil filenames if
there simply <I>were</I> no recommended filenames.  D'oh!


<P>
Fixed redefined parts() method in Entity.


<P>
Fixed bugs in Head where field name wasn't being case folded.


<P><DT><B><A NAME="version">Version 1.10</A></B><DD>

A typo was causing the epilogue of an inner multipart
message to be swallowed to the end of the OUTER multipart
message; this has now been fixed.  
<I>Thanks to Igor Starovoitov for reporting this bug.</I>


<P>
A bad regexp for parameter names was causing 
some parameters to be parsed incorrectly; this has also
been fixed.  
<I>Thanks again to Igor Starovoitov for reporting this bug.</I>


<P>
It is now possible to get full control of the filenaming
algorithm before output files are generated, and the default
algorithm is safer.  
<I>Thanks to Laurent Amon for pointing out the problems, and suggesting 
some solutions.</I>


<P>
Fixed illegal &quot;simple&quot; multipart test file.  D'OH!


<P><DT><B><A NAME="version">Version 1.9</A></B><DD>
