MAJOR CHANGES FROM 3.0 TO 4.0:

   Temp files
	FileHandle::tmpfile is no longer emulated if you have Perl5.004,
	which has fixed the tmpfile() problem; you should (especially
	if running under Win32) get Perl5.004 ASAP.  Otherwise, the
        fairly-portable (if ugly) opendup() emulation is hardcoded.

   Module structure
        MIME::Latin1 is deprecated.
     
        MIME::IO is deprecated; its functionality has been replaced 
        by the IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Wrap modules.
	You will need these to run the toolkit.

	New encodings x-uuencode (x-uu) and x-gzip64 
	are now supported.

        MIME::Decoder has been split into a tree of modules.
   
   Encodings
        The '7bit' encoder now *strips out* 8-bit characters by default;
        it does not use the deprecated MIME::Latin1.
	
	The 'quoted-printable' decoder now uses the newest MIME::QuotedPrint,
	and amends its output with guideline #8 from RFC2049 (From/.).

   Output
        Output format is slightly-different (but more sensible)
        if you use parse_nested_messages() or have singlepart entities
        with parts attached.  
	See MIME::Entity::print for details.

   Debugging
        All toolkit warnings may be turned off with config 'QUIET'.
        See MIME::ToolUtils for details.

MAJOR CHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 2.0:

   Module structure
	As of MIME-tools 2.0...

		MIME::Head is a subclass of Mail::Header
		MIME::Entity is a subclass of Mail::Internet

	If you are upgrading from the MIME-parser 1.0 package, and you used 
	these module directly, you may notice some warnings about deprecated 
	constructs in your code... much your stuff should (hopefully) 
	still work... you'll just see a lot of warnings.  

	There are some true incompatibilities between MIME::Head 1.0 and 
	Mail::Header.  Please read the full documentation before proceeding!
