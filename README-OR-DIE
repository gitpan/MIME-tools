As of MIME-parser 2.0...

	MIME::Head is a subclass of Mail::Header
	MIME::Entity is a subclass of Mail::Internet

If you are upgrading from the MIME-parser 1.0 package, and you used 
these module directly, you may notice some warnings about deprecated 
constructs in your code... much your stuff should (hopefully) 
still work... you'll just see a lot of warnings.  

HOWEVER...

There are some true incompatibilities between MIME::Head 1.0 and 
Mail::Header.  Please read the full documentation before proceeding!

If you desperately need to upgrade, you can emulate the old version's
behavior.  See the MIME::ToolUtils package for details.
