1. FileHandle::tmpfile is emulated

	A bug was discovered in FileHandle::tmpfile that affects
	5.002 and 5.003 at least: it causes a descriptor leak.
	A new tmpfile routine is used in this package, but it has
	not been tested outside of Linux.  You can control this emulation
	in your code: see MIME::ToolUtils for details.

2. Major changes between 1.0 and 2.0:

	As of MIME-parser 2.0...

		MIME::Head is a subclass of Mail::Header
		MIME::Entity is a subclass of Mail::Internet

	If you are upgrading from the MIME-parser 1.0 package, and you used 
	these module directly, you may notice some warnings about deprecated 
	constructs in your code... much your stuff should (hopefully) 
	still work... you'll just see a lot of warnings.  

	HOWEVER...

	There are some true incompatibilities between MIME::Head 1.0 and 
	Mail::Header.  Please read the full documentation before proceeding!

	If you desperately need to upgrade, you can emulate the old version's
	behavior.  See the MIME::ToolUtils package for details.
