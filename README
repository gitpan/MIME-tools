  Programs in this toolkit

        mimeabuse   - try hard to break MIME parsing
        mimedump    - dump out summary of the contents of a parsed MIME message
        mimeencode  - encode a file
        mimeexplode - explode one or more MIME messages
        mimeprint   - parse a MIME stream, and print the parsed entity
        mimesend    - send files via MIME mail, from the command line
        mimetour    - tour the possible encodings

  Layout of the distribution

        ./lib/MIME/         the MIME-tools classes
        ./Makefile.PL       the input to MakeMaker
        ./COPYING           terms and conditions for copying/using the software
        ./README            this file
        ./docs/             HTMLized documentation
        ./etc/              convenient copies of other modules you may need
        ./examples          sample executables
        ./t/*.t             the "make test" scripts
        ./testin/           files you can use for testing (as in "make test")
        ./testout/          the output of "make test"

REQUIREMENTS
    You'll need Perl5.002 or better, but you *should* get 5.004 as soon as
    possible... sorry, but it's the first release I know of with a non-
    broken FileHandle->new_tmpfile method. It's extremely worth upgrading to
    if you're using MIME-tools.

    You'll also need to obtain and install the following kits from the CPAN:

    IO-stringy
        This provides us with filehandle-like interfaces to scalars, and the
        ability to "wrap" foreign filehandles.

    MIME-Base64 (2.04 or higher)
        This kit contains MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint, which perform
        the low-level MIME decoding. Get these from Gisle Aas' author
        directory. They are also reported to be in the LWP distribution.

    MailTools (1.11 or higher)
        This is Graham Barr's revamped set of Mail:: modules. Many of them
        are now superclasses of the MIME:: modules, and perform the core
        functionality of manipulating headers and fields.
