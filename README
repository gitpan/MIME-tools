DESCRIPTION
    MIME-tools is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing,
    decoding, *and generating* single- or multipart (even nested multipart)
    MIME messages. (Yes, kids, that means you can send messages with
    attached GIF files).

REQUIREMENTS
    You will need the following installed on your system:

            File::Path
            File::Spec
            IPC::Open2              (optional)
            IO::Scalar, ...         from the IO-stringy distribution
            MIME::Base64
            MIME::QuotedPrint
            Net::SMTP
            Mail::Internet, ...     from the MailTools distribution.
            Unicode::Map
            Unicode::String

    See the Makefile.PL in your distribution for the most-comprehensive list
    of prerequisite modules and their version numbers.

SUPPORT
    Please email me directly with questions/problems (see AUTHOR below).

    If you want to be placed on an email distribution list (not a mailing
    list!) for MIME-tools, and receive bug reports, patches, and updates as
    to when new MIME-tools releases are planned, just email me and say so.
    If your project is using MIME-tools, it might not be a bad idea to find
    out about those bugs *before* they become problems...

    See the SYNOPSIS entry elsewhere in this document for related
    documentation in this toolkit.

    Users of this toolkit may also wish to see the Mail::Header manpage and
    the Mail::Internet manpage.

    The MIME format is documented in RFCs 2045-2049.

    The MIME header format is an outgrowth of the mail header format
    documented in RFC 822.

    Enjoy. Yell if it breaks.
