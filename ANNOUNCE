NAME

    MIME-parser - family of MIME:: modules for parsing MIME messages

DESCRIPTION

    MIME-parser is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing 
    and decoding single- or multipart (even nested multipart!) MIME 
    messages. 

SYNOPSIS

    You start by creating an instance of MIME::Parser, and setting up
    certain parsing parameters: what directory to save extracted files 
    to, how to name the files, etc.

    You then give that instance a readable filehandle on which waits a
    MIME message.  If all goes well, you will get back a MIME::Entity
    object, consisting of a MIME::Head (which holds the MIME header 
    data) and the name of the file in which the (decoded) body has been 
    stored.

    If the original message was a multipart document, the MIME::Entity
    object will have a non-empty list of "parts", each of which is in 
    turn a MIME::Entity (which might also be a multipart entity, etc, 
    etc...).

    Internally, MIME::Parser asks for instances of MIME::Decoder
    whenever it needs to decode an encoded file.  MIME::Decoder has
    a mapping from supported encodings (e.g., 'base64') to classes
    whose instances can decode them.  You can add to this mapping 
    to try out new/experimental encodings.  You can also use 
    MIME::Decoder by itself.
