Well, this seems a good a time as any... :-)

MIME-tools 2.01a (a.k.a MIME-parser II: The Movie) has been placed
in my user directory (ERYQ) on the CPAN, and should propagate
to a CPAN site near you over the next day or so.  The big changes
have been: 

	* MIME::Head is now a subclass of Mail::Header 
	  (MailTools 1.06).

	* MIME::Entity is now a subclass of Mail::Internet
	  (MailTools 1.06).

	* MIME::Entity now has real easy-to-use tools for composing
	  messages, even ones with attachments.

	* A MIME::Entity can store its data anywhere... support for
	  both disk files and in-core scalars is built in.

	* A lot of the methods now no longer require filehandles...
	  any object conforming to a subset of the IO::Handle interface
	  will do (see MIME::IO for details)

	* A new MIME::ParserBase class separates parsing from
	  output: see how MIME::Parser inherits from it.

WARNING: THIS IS THE INITIAL, ALPHA RELEASE OF THE SOFTWARE.
IF PEOPLE CARP INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT CERTAIN FEATURES, I MAY 
CHANGE THEM BY JANUARY 1997. 

WARNING: DUE TO INCORPORATION WITH MAIL::, IT IS NOT *FULLY*
BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE WITH MIME-PARSER 1.0, AND INSTALLING IT 
ON YOUR SITE AS-IS MAY BREAK MIME-PARSER 1.0 APPLICATIONS!
HOWEVER, THERE IS A SWITCH TO EMULATE THE 1.0 RELEASE ON YOUR SYSTEM,
AND IF YOU NEED TO, I CAN TELL YOU HOW TO GLUE IT IN THE "ON"
POSITION.

There's still some work to do: not all the methods of Mail::Internet
work with MIME::Entity objects yet, and I haven't checked out the
interface to Mail::Send.  But at the very least, you can build
multipart MIME streams that are ready for piping into sendmail(). 
    
Full documentation available in the package.

Suggestions appreciated.  Flames tolerated.  

Enjoy.
